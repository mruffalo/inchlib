4. get_features_for_leaf(leaf_id) method added
5. add_color_scale(color_scale_name, color_scale) method added - color scale form - {"start": {"r":255, "g": 255, "b": 255}, "end": {"r": 0, "g": 0, "b": 0}}, also possible middle color - {"start": {"r":255, "g": 255, "b": 255}, "middle": {"r": 236, "g": 158, "b": 56}, "end": {"r": 0, "g": 0, "b": 0}}
6. InChlib can handla missing values (represented as null), in the heatmap the missing values are inactive white spots
